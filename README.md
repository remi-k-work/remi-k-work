### Hi, I am Remi ðŸ‘‹

While I dabbled in ASP.NET and C# back in the day, my passion for web development has never wavered. These days, I am totally hooked on React, JavaScript, HTML, and CSS - the perfect tools for my front-end development obsession. With an insatiable hunger for knowledge and a commitment to learning, I am seeking internship opportunities to get my hands dirty and contribute to any project that comes my way. Even the simplest tasks would provide invaluable learning experiences as I strive to elevate my web development skills to the next level. I am eager to soak up knowledge from experienced pros and collaborate with a team of brilliant minds, ready to absorb skills and insights to become a true asset to any team.
